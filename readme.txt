compile this program by running g++ *.cpp

you may also run this program directly through the file a.exe 

this program follows all the instructions. 

For customization we introduced bonus riddles 
that you can answer if you get a riddle right.

We also introduced a sorting algorithm 
in the function rankPlayers() contained in main.

Our riddles are really fun you should try them

There were not clear instructions on what to do with the DNA tasks.
So we implemented those functions following the instructions exactly. 
But with the risk of straying away from the assignment;
we elected to make sure its easy for the graders to test.
So when one ends up on those tiles
all it does is print out the result of the functions
from the dna strands the user inputs.
